## Project Title: UNLOCKING SALES INSIGHT; A Sales Data Analysis Trend

### Project Overview
This data analysis uncovers hidden sales insight, as this is crucial for optimizing sales strategies and enhancing growth. My recent project with a retail store provided by the Incubator Hub exemplifies the power of data analysis in achieving this goal. By leveraging on the lessons taught by my wonderful facilitators in this course, I made use of Excel,SQL and Power BI to work on the store's sales data with the aim of discovering trends, patterns and insights that could tell compelling stories around our data and also inform proper business decisions.

### Data Sources
This project made use of Sales data in Microsoft Excel:A comprehensive sheet containing sales data, wheich served as the foundation for data analysis, which was provided by the Incubator Hub.
  
### Tools Used
The Unlocking Sales Insights project relied on a combination of Tools to uncover hidden trends for a retail store and the primary data sources used were;
* Microsoft Excel:Used in cleaning the data set, creating  Pivot Tables and also Charts to properly represent these trends and patterns in this data
* SQL Server:Used to extract and manipulate data, enabling the execution of complex queries to show nuanced insights
* Power BI:Employed to create an interactive dashboard, facilitating effortless exploration and visualization of data.

  ### Data Cleaning and Inspection
  Upon loading the data, I meticulously cleaned and inspected the dataset to identify any errors, incostitences and inaccuracies. I also scanned the dataset to check and remove Null Values, which can lead to biased or skewed analysis if left unaddressed. through rigorous data cleaning, I:
  * Removed duplicates, eliminating data redundancy
  * Identified Null Values, preventing data inaccuracies
  * Ensured data consistency, enebling reliable analysis
  By dedicating tome to data cleaning, I laid a solid foundation for susequent analysis, ensuring the accuracy of insights generated.
