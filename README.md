## Project Title: UNLOCKING SALES INSIGHT; A Sales Data Analysis Trend

### Project Overview
This data analysis uncovers hidden sales insight, as this is crucial for optimizing sales strategies and enhancing growth. My recent project with a retail store provided by the Incubator Hub exemplifies the power of data analysis in achieving this goal. By leveraging on the lessons taught by my wonderful facilitators in this course, I made use of Microsoft Excel,SQL and Power BI to work on the store's sales data with the aim of discovering trends, patterns and insights that could tell compelling stories around our data and also inform proper business decisions.

### Data Sources
This project made use of Sales data in Microsoft Excel:A comprehensive sheet containing sales data, wheich served as the foundation for data analysis, which was provided by the Incubator Hub.
  
### Tools Used
The Unlocking Sales Insights project relied on a combination of Tools to uncover hidden trends for a retail store and the primary data sources used were;
* Microsoft Excel:Used in cleaning the data set, creating  Pivot Tables and also Charts to properly represent these trends and patterns in this data
* SQL Server:Used to extract and manipulate data, enabling the execution of complex queries to show nuanced insights
* Power BI:Employed to create an interactive dashboard, facilitating effortless exploration and visualization of data.

  ### Data Cleaning and Inspection
  Upon loading the data, I meticulously cleaned and inspected the dataset to identify any errors, inconstitencies and inaccuracies. I also scanned the dataset to check and remove Null Values, which can lead to biased or skewed analysis if left unaddressed. By dedicating time to data cleaning, I laid a solid foundation for subsequent analysis, ensuring the accuracy of insights generated and through rigorous data cleaning, I:
  * Removed duplicates, eliminating data redundancy
  * Identified Null Values, preventing data inaccuracies
  * Ensured data consistency, enabling reliable analysis

    ### Exploratory Data Analysis
    This involves the exploring of data to answer questions that can inform decision making in the organizations. some of these questions include;
    * What is the average sales per product?
    * What is the total revenue by region?
    * Which product(s) contributed largely to the revenue?
    * Which product has the lowest revenue?
    * Top selling product by region?
    * What is the overall sales trend?
   
      ### Data Analysis
     This part includes the techniques used in this analysis as my primary objectives were to;
    * Explored and visualized data using Power BI as my visualization tool, which helped to create interactive dashboards and charts,  providing a clear understanding of the data distribution, outliers and relationships
    i I made use of Microsoft Excel to perform statistical analysis and calculate metrics such as total sales per region and average sales per product
    ii Employed SQL to query and manipulate the data in order to extract specific insights like;
    iii Product with the highest sales
    iv Product with the lowest sales
    v Total revenue per product
    vi Top 5 customers by total purchase amount etc.
 
    
     
  
    The Insights uncovered were remarkable as I discovered the following;
    1 Shoes in the product category drove majority of sales with over 3,087,500 as the total sales
    2 All Regions had the same total of sales
    3 Few products like; Shoes, Shirts and Jacket accounted for a large portion of total revenue
    4 Products like socks and gloves did not contribute so much to the revenue in terms of sales
